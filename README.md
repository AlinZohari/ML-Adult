A collaborative binary classification supervised machine learning algorithm to an adult dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository predicting whether an adult earns over $50,000 per year.

This project includes family algorithm, and its learning algorithm as follows:

- Decision Trees: classification tree using CART algorithm. 
- Instance-based Learning: k-Nearest Neighbors 
- Neural Networks: Feedforward Neural Network, FNN 
- Bayesian Learning: GuassianNB, CategoricalNB, BernoulliNB 
- Model Ensembles: Stacking (voting mechanism)
